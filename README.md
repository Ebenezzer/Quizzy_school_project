### Introduction
This project is a quiz app that receives questions from an api called “the trivia app” (https://the-trivia-api.com/). The intent is to build an app where different users can challenge each other to quizzes where the state of a game is stored in a firebase database. In its current state, however, there is no way to save the score or to make an account, so the results of a game are not displayed properly. 
 
### Setup

Required libraries to run the code: firebase version 9, react-firebase-hooks, react-icons, react-router-dom, animate.css
